A Fast Fourier Transform Network
================================

This project contains the "raw" source code for a case study in the PhD thesis "George Ungureanu. ForSyDe-Atom: Design of Heterogeneous Embedded Systems" (link TBA).

Currently this example is not included in any report and the only documentation is Section 6.4.2 of the mentioned thesis. If time allows it, the case study is planned to be included in a future iteration of the "ForSyDe-Atom: User manual".
