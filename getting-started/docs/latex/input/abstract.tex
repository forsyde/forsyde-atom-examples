This document is meant to introduce the reader to using the basic features of \textsc{ForSyDe-Atom} library as a Haskell EDSL for modeling and simulating embedded and cyber-physical systems. It is not meant to substitute the API documentation nor provide any detail on the theoretical foundation, and it references external documents whenever necessary. It goes step-by-step from modeling basics, through a toy example seen from different perspectives, and into more advanced features like creating custom patterns.
