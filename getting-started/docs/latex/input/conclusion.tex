\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:getting-started:conclusion}

This report has introduced the reader to the basic features of \textsc{ForSyDe-Atom} a framework for modeling and testing of cyber-physical systems. It has covered basic usage such as instantiating systems and plotting signals. It briefly went through concepts such as layers, atoms and patterns, and has focused on their practical usage. A step-by-step tutorial has been presented, showing alternative ways to instantiate systems and demonstrating the polymorphism of layers.

The reader is recommended to further consult the \href{\contentsurl}{API documentation} which also acts as a manual for the library, as well as the related publications listed on the \href{https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-atom}{project web site}. Future reports will assume familiarity with using and understanding the framework and will focus mainly on results.
