# ForSyDe Atom Examples

This is a common archive for examples and demonstrators for [ForSyDe-Atom](https://github.com/forsyde/forsyde-atom). Each project is distributed as a separate [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)ized library, meant to be installed and tested in its own separate **sandbox**. All code sources have been written using the literate programming style and can generate a report for each project. These reports are bundled periodically in form of a [user manual](manual.pdf).


## List of examples

These are the projects included in this repository:

 * [`getting-started`](getting-started): a brief introduction to the main ForSyDe-Atom concepts and features.
 * [`hybrid`](hybrid): some examples and experiments for hybrid CT/DT models. 
 * [`fft`](fft): an example of a FFT system built using skeletons.
 * [`adc`](adc): a SAR-ADC used to demonstrate the usage of different layers in ForSyDe-Atom.
 * [`quad`](quad): a quad-copter flight controller.
