\label{sec:hybrid:goals}

The reader is assumed to have been familiarized with the \textsc{ForSyDe-Atom} modeling framework. A good resource for that is \chapterref{ch:getting-started}. The main goals of this \SelfRef\ are:
\begin{itemize}
\item explore alternative \textsc{ForSyDe-Atom} models for widely known hybrid (discrete and continuous time) systems, with the scope of analyzing the implications from the modeling and simulation perspective.
\item train the reader into the decision-making process of modeling hybrid systems, and the trade-offs involved. While as per writing this report the \textsc{ForSyDe-Atom} modeling framework is still limited, future directions are hinted.
\item support the associated scientific publications with the complete experiments and results for the models used as case studies. These publications include: \cite{ungureanu18a}.
\end{itemize}
