This \SelfRef\ gathers examples and experiments which involve hybrid models focusing on the the semantics and implications of combining and translating between continuous and discrete domains. As such, the focus is mainly on exploring alternative models and analyzing the implications on fidelity, precision and performance. This \SelfRef\ is also meant to support the associated scientific publications with experimental results.
